A Java client-library for simplified access to the VAMDC registry of resources.

This library wraps the AstroGrid delegate for the IVOA registry-access protocol
and adds higher-level features.

The code in this source-repository is a Maven project. Dependencies can be
taken from the Maven repository at

http://ag03.ast.cam.ac.uk/nexus/content/groups/public/

which provides both the "standard" artifacts from the Maven central repository
and the AstroGrid artifacts.
